# Orbital 2022- SG Parking

A new Flutter project, the objective of this project is to create an app that would be able to give users an accurate description of parking occupancy rates
should they wish to visit any mall in Singapore.

## Getting Started

This project is currently being built using Flutter, to play around with the interface, follow the instructions to download the project onto android studio and use a virtual device to view and interact with it.

The steps are listed below:
1. Download Flutter, Android studio and the Appropriate SDK tools, the following YouTube Video demonstrates it very well (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ukSR1GRtMU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ).
2. Next make sure to download git from here (https://git-scm.com/downloads), this is to ensure that we can import the flutter project from Github.
3. Once you've downloaded all the essentials, one could follow the tutorial to import the code into flutter (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-import-a-flutter-project-from-github/#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Open%20Git%20Bash,bash%20to%20clone%20the%20repository.&text=Step%205%3A%20The%20repository%20will,cloned%20in%20the%20Lenovo%20folder.)
4. Once you've imported all the necessary tools, look at the following video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du8XaKw0jO0) to add a virtual device onto android studio. NOTE:
          a) Instead of Nougat, make sure to select Pie as the appropriate release.
          b) Make sure to enable Hardware rendering under graphics (1:23 in the YouTube Video).
5. Now to run the the project on the virtual device, follow the instructions in the following video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSIhiZ5jRB0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ&index=4) from 7:35 - 7:50. This would allow you to select the virtual device.
6. Next to run the project, make sure to go to the terminal, and enter the following command:
        a) flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
7. Head to the Virtual Device and test you the feature, do check if the parking occupancy rates are accurate!
